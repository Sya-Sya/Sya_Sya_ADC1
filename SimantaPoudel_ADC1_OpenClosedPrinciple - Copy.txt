Solid Principle
Open/closed principle

‘O’ in SOLID stands for Open/Closed Principle. It is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle as code written with Single Responsibility in mind tends to comply with the Open/Closed Principle too.
Open/Closed Principle says that the code should be open for extension but closed for modification. In other words, the code should be organized in such a way that new modules can be added without modifying the existing code.

Code:
def read_localfile(file):
    '''Read file'''
    return open(file, "r").read()

def count_word_occurrences(word, content):
    '''Count number of word occurrences in a file'''

 counter = 0
    for e in content.split():
        if word.lower() == e.lower():
            counter += 1
    return counter
